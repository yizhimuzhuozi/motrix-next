## Why Motrix Next?

[Motrix](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix) by [agalwood](https://github.com/agalwood) was one of the best open-source download managers available — clean UI, aria2-powered, cross-platform. It inspired thousands of users and developers alike.

However, the original project has been largely inactive since 2023. The Electron + Vue 2 + Vuex + Element UI stack accumulated technical debt, making it increasingly difficult to maintain, extend, or package for modern platforms.

### What we kept

We owe a great deal to the original [Motrix](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix) and its community. The following were gratefully adopted and continue to serve as the foundation for parts of Motrix Next:

- **Aria2 error code system and RPC client** — the error handling conventions and JSON-RPC communication layer for the aria2 engine
- **Internationalization** — 25+ community-contributed locale files covering Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, French, German, and many more
- **Download utilities** — tracker list management, cURL command parsing, and other protocol-level helpers

### What we rebuilt

**Motrix Next is not a fork — it is a complete rewrite.** Every other layer of the application has been redesigned and reimplemented from scratch:

| Layer | Motrix (Legacy) | Motrix Next |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Runtime** | Electron | **Tauri 2** (Rust) |
| **Frontend** | Vue 2 + Vuex | **Vue 3 Composition API + Pinia** |
| **UI Framework** | Element UI | **Naive UI** |
| **Language** | JavaScript | **TypeScript + Rust** |
| **Styling** | SCSS + Element theme | **Vanilla CSS + custom properties** |
| **Engine Mgmt** | Node.js `child_process` | **Tauri sidecar** |
| **Build System** | electron-builder | **Vite + Cargo** |
| **Bundle Size** | ~80 MB | **~10 MB** |
| **Auto-Update** | electron-updater | **Tauri updater plugin** |

Version numbering starts at `1.0.0` to reflect this clean break.

## Features

- **Multi-protocol downloads** — HTTP, FTP, BitTorrent, Magnet links
- **BitTorrent** — Selective file download, DHT, peer exchange, encryption
- **Tracker management** — Auto-sync from community tracker lists
- **Concurrent downloads** — Up to 10 tasks with configurable thread count
- **Speed control** — Global and per-task upload/download limits
- **System tray** — Real-time speed display in the menu bar (macOS)
- **Dark mode** — Native dark theme as default
- **Task management** — Pause, resume, delete with file cleanup, batch operations
- **Download protocols** — Register as default handler for magnet and thunder links
- **Notifications** — System notifications on task completion
- **Lightweight** — Tauri-based, ~10 MB bundle size (down from ~80 MB), minimal resource footprint

## Installation

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AnInsomniacy/motrix-next/releases).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnInsomniacy/motrix-next.git
cd motrix-next

# Install frontend dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (launches Tauri + Vite)
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

└── package.json
```

### Versioning

`Cargo.toml` is the single source of truth for the application version. `tauri.conf.json` omits the `version` field intentionally — Tauri reads it from `Cargo.toml` at build time, and the About panel reads it via `getVersion()` at runtime.

To bump the version, edit only `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
version = "1.0.3"
```

### Release

Pushing a version tag triggers the CI pipeline which builds for all supported platforms:

```bash
git tag v1.0.3
git push origin v1.0.3
```

| Platform | Runner | Artifacts |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| macOS ARM64 | `macos-latest` | `.dmg` |
| Windows x64 | `windows-latest` | `.exe` (NSIS) |
| Linux x64 | `ubuntu-latest` | `.AppImage` + `.deb` |
| Linux ARM64 | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `.AppImage` + `.deb` |

The workflow creates a draft release with all artifacts and a `latest.json` manifest for in-app auto-updates.
